        An event is a signal that something has happened.

        All DOM nodes generate such signals.

        Some of the most useful groups of DOM events are:
        - mouse events,
        - keyboard events,
        - form element events,
        - document events.

        click > when mouse clicks on an element

        context menu > when the mouse right-clicks on an element

        mouseover/mouseout > when the mouse cursor comes over/leaves the element

        mousedown/mouseup > when the mouse button is pressed/released over an element

        mousemove > when mouse is moved



        Form element events:
        submit - when the visitor submits a form
        focus - when the visitor focuses on a form element (input)

        Keyboard events:
        keydown and keyup - when the visitor presses and then releases the button

        Document events:
        DOMContentLoaded - when the HTML is loaded and DOM is fully built



        To react on events we can assign a HANDLER. /Function that we assign when event happen

        Handler is a function that runs when the event occurs

        There are several ways to assign a handler function to an event:
        - HTML attribute
        - DOM property
        - addEventListener  //most widely used


        From one side we have HTML with attributes and on other side we have NODE that has properties. Properties in Node are JavaScript representation of HTML attributes.


        HTML Attribute I

        A handler can be set in HTML with an attribute named on<event>


        DOM Property

        We can assign a handler using a DOM property on<event>


        HTML Attribute and DOM Property

        Browser transforms HTML-attribute handler to DOM property. The handler is always in the DOM property, the HTML-attribute is just one of the ways to initialize it.


        addEventListener I

        There is no way to attach multiple  without addEventListener
